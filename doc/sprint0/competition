FitApp has many competitors on mobile platforms. The biggest competitor is undoubtedly myfitnesspal. This kind of software can not only provide physical data records 
similar to FitApp, but also can help users obtain nutritional information. However, the function of myfitnesspal is more aimed at losing weight, and it does not provide 
training suggestions for different goals of different people (such as training content, training intensity, training plan, etc.). FitApp can undoubtedly stand out in 
training assistance.

There are also some software like adidas running, under armour MapMyRun, etc. These apps allow users to connect to certain gadgets and provide certain assistance to the 
user's training (for example, under amour shoes can be connected to MapMyRun through Bluetooth, which can help users correct running pattern). These products are mainly 
for a specific training and there is a high demand for additional products. FitApp is lighter and easier for users to use.

There are also softwares like Fitdays that specifically monitor body metrics. It can accurately record the user's weight, body fat, etc. through a smart body scale. But 
Fitdays does not have fitness and nutrition guidance, so FitApp can provide more comprehensive help.

People's demand for healthy living is growing, and they need a tool that can help them record healthy living and assist them. Fit can increase its competitiveness by help
people from three comprehensive dimensions of training, nutrition, and physical indicators, and improve user stickiness through a series of functions such as social 
networking. We believe that FitApp will become a software that can better help users maintain health.
