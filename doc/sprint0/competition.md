FitApp has many competitors on mobile platforms. The biggest competitor is undoubtedly Myfitnesspal. This kind of software can not only provide physical data records 
similar to FitApp, but also can help users obtain nutritional information. However, the features of Myfitnesspal are more aimed at helping users lose weight, and it does not provide training suggestions for different goals of different people (such as training content, training intensity, training plan, etc.). FitApp can undoubtedly stand out in training assistance provided to the users.

There are also some software like Adidas Running, under armour MapMyRun, etc. These apps allow users to connect to certain gadgets and provide certain assistance to the 
user's training (for example, under amour shoes can be connected to MapMyRun through Bluetooth, which can help users correct running pattern). These products are mainly 
for a specific type of training and additional products are required for using these certain apps. FitApp is lighter and easier for users to use in the perspective of training assistance.

There are also softwares like Fitdays that are designed specifically for monitoring body metrics. It can accurately record the user's weight, body fat, etc. through a smart body scale. But Fitdays does not have training assistance and nutrition guidance, so FitApp can provide more comprehensive assisitance.

People's demand for healthy living is growing, and they need a tool that can help them record healthy living and assist them. The FitApp's competitiveness comes from helping people from three comprehensive dimensions of training, nutrition, and physical indicators, and improve user loyalty through a series of functions such as social 
networking. We believe that FitApp will become a software that can better help users keep fit in daily life.
