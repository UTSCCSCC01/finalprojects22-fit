### Meetings

We will be communicating mainly through discord, and also be holding our group meetings on discord. We will meet minimum 3 times a week, on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday at 11am. During the meetings we will first each talk about what we have completed, sharing our screen to show our progress. Then we will provide feedback and discuss about our already completed work. Lastly, we will talk about what we will be working on until the next meeting.

### Decision Making

We would usually bring up difficulties, ideas or questions in the group chat, and then we would come to a descision during the group meetings. For the meetings we would discuss or options and present the pros and cons of the decisions and then we would make a vote on our decision, and we would go for the decision that the majority voted for. 

### Prioritizing User Stories

When it came to the priority of user stories, we would individually look at each user story, discuss the specific feature it would implement and then we would vote on whether it was high, medium or low priority, going by the majority vote. The high priority means that this feature from the user story is a very basic feature that is necessary for our app. The medium priority means that this feature from the user story is a desired feature for our app and we plan on implementing this feature right after the basics are done. The low priority means that this feature from the user story is more of a delighter for our users and is a nice bonus for our app, but it's not necessary to have it completed by the end of the project.

### Next Phase

When completing our work, we realized that we assigned too big of a task given our time between meetings, since we only have 2 days to work in between the group meetings, we didn't always get the quality we wanted for our final submission, so we had to further edit and polish our work after each meeting in additional to other work we had assigned to us by the next meeting. So in the future, we need to assign more appropriate work given the time frame.
