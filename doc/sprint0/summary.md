<h2>Project Objective</h2>

Build a comprehensive mobile fitness application to track diet and exercise. Keep users engaged with the application by providing continuous, explicit, and positive feedback with visible in-app progression. Make a system that is inclusive to individuals at any level of fitness, by providing exactly as much assistance and guidance as necessary.

<h2>The Key Personas</h2>

Andre - A fitness expert that has been active within the field for nearly a decade. He creates his own personal workout routines and tracks everything he consumes diligently

Rachael - A 16-year-old high school student completely new to the world of fitness and unsure how to proceed. Intimidated and sometimes uneasy from getting in-person advice. Strongly motivated to begin, she just does not know how to start.

<h2>The Key Scenarios</h2>

After coming home from work Andre starts to prepare his evening meal. A steak and bean burrito bowl for which every ingredient is individual measured, and a bit of sauce from a bottle he bought earlier at Food Basics. Hungry and waiting to eat, he first needs to quickly log his food intake.

A beginner has been on a diet and exercise plan for two months and has seen little visible results. They find their regiment to be difficult and are losing the motivation to continue it. The user feels like they're wasting their time and are in need of additional motivation.

A university student takes the bus home after attending three back-to-back lectures. They had Tim Hortons double-double coffee and chocolate chip muffin for breakfast, and for lunch ate a sandwich with a sprite to drink. They are about to eat a granola bar, but want to check that they aren't eating over 50 grams of sugar today.

<h2>The Key Principles</h2>

Fitness at any level - The app should be able to give plenty of assistance to those who need it. Simultaneously, the app should never feel intrusive or demanding of users that can be more independent. 

Intuitive, simple design - The most frequently used features of the app should be easy and quick to find. The design and logical flow of the app should never be complicated enough to overwhelm the userbase.
