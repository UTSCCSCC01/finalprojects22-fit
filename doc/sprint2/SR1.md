* Working on documentation along the way

**Harmful practices that should stop**

**Best and worst experience with sprint1**

* The team was overall very supportive, and members are are quick to take on new tasks and initiatives as they come up.

* There were a few instances where the team was blindsighted by some of the requirements regarding the assignment, specifically, the tasks related to project tracking via JIRA.
