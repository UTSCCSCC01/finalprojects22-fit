## Sprint2 Retrospective Meeting

**Participants:**

* Shuhong Duan
* Collin Hei Lok Chan
* Vincent Liang
* Matthew Melchior
* Ziyue Gong


**Unfinished tasks:** 

* FIT-45 (Subtask FIT-75)

**Good practices that should continue**

* Having frequent productive stand up meetings
* Spreading out work across the sprint
* Creating pull requests earlier within the sprint

**New practices that should be implemented**

* Ensuring development & non-development (i.e., JIRA documentation) related blockers are completed early on within the sprint.

**Harmful practices that should stop**

* Not updating tickets on JIRA as tickets are being completed.
* Not ensuring that all non-developmental requirements are met.

**Best and worst experience with sprint2**

* Team collaboration improved greatly in regard to merging work and aiding each other. 

* Some branches could not be merged by the expected time, so group members had to use different versions of the app during demo.
