## Sprint2 Retrospective Meeting

**Participants:**

* Shuhong Duan
* Collin Hei Lok Chan
* Vincent Liang
* Matthew Melchior
* Ziyue Gong

**Unfinished tasks:** 

* FIT-43

**Good practices that should continue**

* Spreading out work across the sprint.
* Collaborative work and reviews throughout sprint.

**New practices that should be implemented**

* Ensuring development & non-development (i.e., JIRA documentation) related blockers are completed early on within the sprint.
* Standup messages should always be written regardless of whether or not group member was able to attend on time. 

**Harmful practices that should stop**

* Not updating tickets on JIRA as tickets are being completed, adjusting estimates as ticket progresses.
* Some lack of communication, absence during standup without notice or standup message posted after the fact. 

**Best and worst experience with sprint2**

* High volume of work completed during sprint, many features successfully added to the application. 

* Very few branches managed to get merged prior to sprint deadline.
